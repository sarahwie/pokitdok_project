To run subsets on PokitDok huge datafile:

1) split dataset into 5 subsets
$ mkdir parts
$ split --number=l/5 npidata_20170108.jsonl


2) To combine 5 subsets of re-written-out .jsonl files
$ cat file1.jsonl file2.jsonl > combinedfile.jsonl


3) To make sure that number of lines in combined file matches sum of num. lines in each subset file
$ wc -l * 


4) To compress:
$ gzip combinedfile.jsonl


Note: 
$head -n 1 filename.jsonl
gives you the first record since .jsonl format has each json element as a file line
