# pokitdok_project

This repository contains code for performing a rating calculation that can be used to rank medical providers. An article detailing this project and promotional video can be found here: https://fullmetalhealth.com/docrank-computer-science-capstone-project-college-charleston/. The code used to rank the providers and create the web app search tool can be found in my collaborators' repositories, Ryan Lile at https://github.com/lilerw/Pokitdoc-Project for the web app, and Kaya Tollas at https://github.com/kayat95/PokitdokProject for the data cleaning and merging of disparate datasources.

The main file for reference in this directory is final_ranking_algorithm.ipynb. This file includes reading in the given datafile, building feature vectors, populating a wins/losses matrix and a Colley matrix, and inverting the matrix to produce the vector of rankings for the given input file.

Due to time constraints, I was not able to be particularly neat and documentative when writing my code- please reach out if you have any questions.
